Guide to the ScaleIO Cinder plugin ver. NNN for Fuel
****************************************************

Introduction
============
This guide provides instructions on installing, configuring and using
ScaleIO Cinder plugin for Fuel.
The ScaleIO plugin allows OpenStack to work with an **External** ScaleIO
deployment. This ScaleIO plugin for Fuel extends Mirantis OpenStack
functionality by adding support for ScaleIO block storage.

ScaleIO is a software-only solution that uses existing servers' local
disks and LAN to create a virtual SAN that has all the benefits of
external storageâ€”but at a fraction of cost and complexity. ScaleIO
utilizes the existing local internal storage and turns it into internal
shared block storage.
